### Project


#### Task 1: Open Seed Project

The Seed Project is in the `/assignment` directory of the Week 1 repo. Open the `index.html` file.
Take a look at the text between the second set of `<script>` tagsâ€”this is the Javascript code we
will be editing for this assignment.


#### Task 2: Change the marker location to your favorite place to eat food in Philadelphia

The part of the code that adds a marker looks like this: `L.marker([50.5, 30.5]).addTo(map);`.
The `50.5, 30.5` part refers to a set of coordinates: latitude and longitude (lat, lng).

In our class, we'll learn a number of ways to find coordinates for a location that we want to map.
An easy way to do this for a single address is to use Google Maps. Check out these instructions
to [Get the coordinates of a place](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?hl=en).


#### Task 3: Add two more markers

Add two additional markers to your map. These two markers should be two additional places where
you like to eat food.

To add an additional marker, copy the code you used to create the first marker onto the next
line. Change the coordinates for your new markers. When you are finished, save your file and
reload the browser. You should see three markers.


#### Extra

In this class, we are using a Javascript library called [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to handle
mapping in the browser. You can check out the [Leaflet Docs](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html)
to get an idea of what it can do.

Later, we'll explore an exciting alternative to Leaflet -
[Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). The 'GL' means it tries to take advantage
of graphics cards to generate powerful vizualisations incredibly quickly). Mapbox is a bit
more involved and we won't be touching on it until the second half of the course but the
[examples provided by Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/) are
worth clicking through for inspiration and a sense of where we're headed.
